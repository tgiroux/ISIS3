   *   @history 2009-01-22 Jeannie Walldren - Original Version
   *   @history 2009-08-28 Steven Lambright - Changed inheritance to no longer
   *                           inherit directly from Camera.  Camera is now pure
   *                           virtual, parent class is FramingCamera.
   *   @history 2010-09-16 Steven Lambright - Updated unitTest to not use a DEM.
   *   @history 2011-01-14 Travis Addair - Added new CK/SPK accessor methods,
   *                           pure virtual in Camera, implemented in mission
   *                           specific cameras.
   *   @history 2011-02-09 Steven Lambright - Major changes to camera classes.
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Added ShutterOpenCloseTimes()
   *                           method. Updated unitTest to test for new methods.
   *                           Updated documentation. Replaced Clementine
   *                           namespace wrap with Isis namespace. Added Isis
   *                           Disclaimer to files. Added NAIF error check to
   *                           constructor. Changed centertime in constructor to
   *                           add half exposure duration to start time to
   *                           maintain consistency with other Clementine models.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook, Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis 
   *                           coding standards. References #972.
   *   @history 2015-08-12 Ian Humphrey and Makayla Shepherd - Added new data members and methods
   *                           to get spacecraft and instrument names. Extended unit test to test
   *                           these methods.
   *   @history 2015-10-16 Ian Humphrey - Removed declarations of spacecraft and instrument 
   *                           members and methods and removed implementation of these methods
   *                           since Camera now handles this. References #2335.
