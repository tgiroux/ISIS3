   *  @history 2005-10-03 Elizabeth Miller - Modified file to support Doxygen
   *                           documentation
   *  @history 2008-08-08 Steven Lambright Made the unit test work with a Sensor
   *                           change. Also, now using the new LoadCache(...) method instead of
   *                           createCache(...).
   *  @history 2009-03-08 Debbie A. Cook Removed reference to obsolete LineScanCameraDetectorMap
   *                           method SetXAxisTimeDependent
   *   @history 2009-08-28 Steven Lambright - Changed inheritance to no longer
   *                           inherit directly from Camera
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Updated unitTest to test for new
   *                           methods. Added NAIF error check. Removed Mro namespace.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook, Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis 
   *                           coding standards. References #972.
   *   @history 2015-08-12 Ian Humphrey and Makayla Shepherd - Added new data members and methods
   *                           to get spacecraft and instrument names. Extended unit test to test
   *                           these methods.
   *   @history 2015-10-16 Ian Humphrey - Removed declarations of spacecraft and instrument 
   *                           members and methods and removed implementation of these methods
   *                           since Camera now handles this. References #2335.
