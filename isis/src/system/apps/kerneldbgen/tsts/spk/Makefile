# SPK Test for kerneldbgen
# This test creates an output database file from the SPICE tables in the input file
# that follow the given filter for reconstructed spk file name patterns.
# Note that the array style for this input is \("pattern1","pattern2"\)
#
# After the output PVL is created, when compared, the DIFF file indicates to
# ignore RunTime and File.  The File keyword is ignored since, depending on 
# where the test is run, files may have different paths. These paths can not be 
# removed since they may be long enough to take up multiple lines.
#
# The kernelFileNamesWithPath file is created to pull out the File keyword
# values, in order.  This is then passed into SED, removing the paths and 
# leaving only the ordered kernel names.
