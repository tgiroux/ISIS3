                                  the MDIS wide-angle camera, with pixel
                                  binning turned on (MESS:FPU_BIN = 1). It
                                  is used to correct raw DN to units of
                                  radiance, after correction for dark level,
                                  frame transfer smear, linearity, and flat
                                  field. The responsivity is in units of DN
                                  per unit time per unit radiance. It is
                                  dependent on filter position f
                                  (FILTER_NUMBER), CCD temperature T
                                  (MESS:CCD_TEMP), and binning state b
                                  (MESS:FPU_BIN).

                                  Exposure time t is in raw units of ms
                                  (MESS:EXPOSURE or EXPOSURE_DURATION) and
                                  radiance in units of
                                  W / (m**2 microns**1 sr**1).

                                  Responsivity is calculated as
                                  using a second-order polynomial as
                                  Resp(f,T,b) = R(f,t=-30.3C,b) *
                                  [correction_offset(f,b) + T(CCD) *
                                  correction_coef1(f,b) + T(CCD)^2 *
                                  correction_coef2(f,b)]

                                  where

                                  Resp(f,T,b) is responsivity in filter f
                                  at CCD temperature T in binning state b,

                                  T(CCD) is raw CCD temperature in units
                                  of DNs,

                                  R(f,t=-30.3C,b) is responsivity in filter
                                  f in binning state b at CCD temperature
                                  of 1060 DN (-30.3C),

                                  correction_offset(f,b) is camera- and

                                  offset for filter f and binning state b,

                                  correction_coef1(f,b) is the camera- and
                                  filter-dependent temperature correction
                                  first-order coefficient for filter f and
                                  binning state b.

                                  correction_coef2(f,b) is the camera- and
                                  filter-dependent temperature correction
                                  second-order coefficient for filter f and
                                  binning state b.

                                  The temperature correction defaults to
                                  unity at CCD temperature of 1060 DN
                                  (-30.3C).

                                  To apply responsivity to obtain radiance
                                  L, the expression is
                                  L = DN_dk_sm_lin_fl / (t * Resp(f,T,b))

                                  where

                                  DN_dk_sm_lin_fl is dark-, smear-,
                                  linearity-, and flat field-corrected DN,

                                  t is the exposure time in milliseconds,

                                  Resp(f,T,b) is the responsivity."
