  <brief>
    Corrects a known striping pattern in HiRISE images.
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
    In mixed mode HiRISE images, there is a tendency for every other line in the 
	 ccd with the lower binning mode to be significantly darker or lighter than 
	 normal image data would suggest. This program attempts to correct that 
	 problem. 2 passes through a cube are necessary to perform the correction. The 
	 first pass gathers information on each line of the cube to determine if the 
	 striping phenomenon occurs in odd numbered lines or in even numbered lines, and
	 also gathers information to perform the actual correction.
	 </p>
	 The second pass through the data performs the actual correction, of which there
	 are two different types. The default, an additive correction, is of the following
	 form for each pixel
	 
	 <pre>
    					     
                                         ((Line[i-1]) + Line[i+1])
                Pixel[i,j] - Line[i] +   --------------------------
                                                      2
    </pre>
	 
	 The other correction, a multiplicative correction of a similar style, is of
	 the form
	 
    <pre>
                Pixel        ((Line[i-1]) + Line[i+1])
               -------   *  ---------------------------
               Line[i]                    2
    </pre>
	 <p>
	 It should finally be noted that the striping pattern has been observed to
	 be most prevalent in a certain quardrant of the image, though that phase
	 is not the same for all images. In order to address this irregularitiy, the 
	 line averages shown above are not for the entire line, but only for the 
	 quarter of the line in which sample i exists. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Caution should be taken when running hidestripe: it should only be run on
	 images where different CCDs are run at different binning modes. Of those,
	 only channels that are not used in the highest binning mode of the image
	 should be corrected. For example, if an image has binning modes 1, 2, and 4
	 the CCDs with modes 1 and 2 may be hidestripe'd, but in an image that is 
	 only binned in modes 1 and 2, the bin 1 CCDs are the only ones that need 
	 the hidestripe correction.
	 </p>
