      Tonematches a set of HiRISE cubes prior to mosaicking
  </brief>

  <description>
      <p>
        This program can be used to tonematch or equalize the brightness and 
        contrast of the input HiRISE cubes prior to mosaicking. The set of N
        cubes inputed must be all Red, all Blue-Green, or all Infared, where N 
        is an integer 2-10 for RED sets and exactly 2 both for IR and BG sets. 
        The order the cube names are provided in does not matter, but the cubes 
        must all follow a linear sequence without skipping cubes all the same 
        (i.e., the user cannot run this application on cubes RED1-RED3 and RED5 
        without also providing the program RED4).  Statistics are gathered by 
        line, taking into account the bin number of the cube (automatically 
        derived from the number of samples in the line).  The statistics are 
        used in an IntersectionStatistics object's least squares solution to 
        determine multiplicative and additive corrections to each image.  The 
        user has the option to stop the processing after the statistics and 
        corrective factors have been computed for examination. Alternatively, 
        the processing can continue and the corrective factors will be applied 
        to each image (by making sure the APPLY checkbox is ticked).  The actual
        equation to be used for each cube is:
        <pre>
            newdn(s,l)   =   (olddn(s,l) - avg()) * MULT() + avg() + BASE()
        </pre> where
        <pre>
            s = sample index
            l = line index 
          </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
          The BASE and MULT values are computed independently for each image, therefore we have two
          least squares computations with M unknowns, where M is the number of 
          cubes to be equalized. The intersections, O, between all the cubes are 
          computed and O &lt; M should hold in all cases.  In order for the
          least squares equation to be solved, there must be at least as many
          knowns as unknowns.  Therefore, you must hold one or more cubes to 
          alleviate this problem.  Holding a cube forces MULT and BASE to 1.0 
          and 0.0 respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
         If the APPLY option is selected, the equalized cubes will be named the same as the input cubes
         with the addition of a '.equ' prior to the '.cub' extension.

      <brief> RED Images Equalized </brief>
      <description>
        This example shows the use of the hiequal application with default 
        settings (i.e., no TO file with APPLY set true).  For demonstrative 
        purposes, the first image (RED0) has had its pixel values multiplied by 
        .8 with the "fx" application, and the two images have been mosaicked 
        together with "hiccdstitch".
