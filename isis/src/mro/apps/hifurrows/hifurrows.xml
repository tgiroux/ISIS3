  <brief>
    Null furrowed pixels 
  </brief>

  <description>
    The original version of the program works by finding the correlation 
    between the columns in an input image.  With a Channel 0 image, the first 
    five columns are examined; in a Channel 1 image, the last five columns are 
    examined (Channel 2 images are not supported). <br/><br/>
    If the statistical results suggest a furrow is detected (i.e. the 
    correlation between two columns is below a certain threshold), then the 
    affected column is replaced with Null pixels. If an input image does not 
    have a furrow, none of its pixels will be altered.  The label of all output 
    files will include a new group called "Correlations."  This group lists the 
    correlations between the relevant columns.  For example, "Column3to2 
    0.987..." means there is a strong positive correlation between columns 2 and 
    3 (and very unlikely to have a furrow in the area).  

    <br/><br/>
    For the newer version, the processing has been taken from the Version 1.42 
    of the original HiCal pipeline perl script and processes images with summing 
    modes 2 and 4 only. 
    <br/> <br/>
    Furrows are checked only in the columns which are based on Channel and the 
    Summing mode.  Each specified column will have a Threshold DN based on the 
    Summing mode and CcdId. Then the starting sample and number of samples in 
    the specified columns are determined based on the Summing mode and Channel. 
    The DN value of pixels in these samples are checked to be in the  0 and 
    respective Threshold range.  If not, they are determined to be 
    a furrow and set to NULL. If a furrow was found, then trimfilter and 
    lowpass(if option is set) are run on the image in a pipeline to smooth the 
    edges which were Nulled due to the furrows.
