      <h2>What's the deal?</h2>


      <h3>The Document XML Metadata File</h3>
      <p>
        The metadata file example2.xml contains all the bibliographic, history, and basic file information for the Document.
        The metadata file specifies that the Document content is HTML that is to be created from the contents of the metadata file.
        The files/file/body/src element references this file as its source of content.
      </p>

      <h3>What will happen to this file?</h3>
      <p>
        When Isis is built, the metadata file will be converted into a web page. The bibliographic information will be output as summary
        information in the HTML file, preset page headers and footers will be used, with the title (and subtitle) from the metadata used in the
        page header. The file specified by files/file/body/src will be inserted into the body of the HTML file between the page header and footer.
      </p>
