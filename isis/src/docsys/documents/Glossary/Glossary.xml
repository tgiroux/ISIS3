          <definition name="Adjusted">
            The term, Adjusted, refers to the output pixel coordinate or output geographic location
            within a control network.  Applications such as <i>pointreg</i> or <i>jigsaw</i> 
	    report and update the "Adjusted" output pixel coordinate (<i>pointreg</i>) or
	     geographic location (<i>jigsaw</i>) in the output control network.
          </definition>

          <definition name="A Priori">
            The term, "A Priori", refers to the initial or original value of a pixel coordinate or
            geographic location within a control network.  Applications such as <i>pointreg</i> or 
	    <i>jigsaw</i>
            refer to the a priori values for an input pixel coordinate (<i>pointreg</i>) or geographic
            location (<i>jigsaw</i>) in an input control network.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Band">
            A 3rd dimensional layer of pixels in an image, typically representing spectral
            information.  The number of bands indicates the depth of an image in
            terms of these layers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit">
            Short for binary digit, which in a computer is the smallest unit of
            storage. Bits are either "0" or "1".
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit Type">
            Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an
            image cube file.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            most modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
            <p>
               Within the ISIS environment, "Byte" refers to how many bits there are
               per single meaningful value in an image cube file.  The Byte information
               for an image cube file is stored on the image cube labels in Group=Pixels, where
               the keywords Type and ByteOrder describe the byte format.

         <definition name="Serial Number">
            A unique identifier constructed and assigned to each individual
            image within a control network.  The serial number (SN) is
            constructed by most of the control network applications "in real
            time" from specific instrument keywords on the image labels
            (Instrument keywords are populated by mission specific ingestion
            applications).

              The serial number associated with each control measure is included
              as a field in the binary control network.  ISIS <i>getsn</i>

          <definition name="Reference Measure">
            Reference Measure is a fundamental component of the control network.
            For every point within the network, there is always one and only one
            associated Reference Measure (Reference=True).  The Reference
            Measure refers to a single image and it's pixel coordinate (measure)
            that best represents a control point location or feature.
            <p>
              This specific element of the control network is exclusively used for
              co-registering all other overlapping and potential measures (images)
              to the Reference Measure.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are control network applications that can set the Reference=True
              explicitly (<i>cnetref</i>, <i>qnet</i>) or 'runtime' implicitly 
	      (If reference is not set, the implicit default is the first 
	      'valid' measure listed within a control point,
              refer to the <i>pointreg</i> application for more information).
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube">
            A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and
            bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of
            samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).
            <p>
              Typically, the sample and line dimensions are used to represent
              spatial information while the band dimension represents spectral
              information.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line">
            A row of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial

            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample">
            A column of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of samples indicates the total width of an image

          </definition>

          <definition name="Digital Number">
            The numeric value of a single pixel in an image. The value may
            represent almost any unit. For example: reflectance (I/F), radiance,

            Level0 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been ingested into ISIS (PDS EDR) and will often have
            SPICE information loaded on the ISIS cube labels (<i>spiceinit</i>).
            Level0 image cubes are often the input to mission specific
            radiometric calibration applications if supported in ISIS.
            <p>
              Level0 implies a 'non-projected', raw image cube ('camera space').

            loaded on the ISIS cube labels.
            <p>
              This level will often represent an image that also has had  noise removed.
              ISIS reports the camera geometry (viewing geometry of an image cube) for
              a Level1. Most ISIS application names that starts with a prefix of 'cam'
              expect a Level1  cube as input (refer to applications such as 
	      <i>camstats</i>, <i>campt</i>, and <i>cam2map</i>).
            </p>
            <p>

          <definition name="Level2">
            Level2 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an

            characteristics.
            <p>
               Most ISIS applications that start with a prefix of
              'map' expects a Level2 cube as input (refer to applications such as
               <i>mappt</i>, <i>map2map</i>, and <i>map2cam</i>).

          <definition name="Radius">
            The distance (vector) value between the center of and a point on a
            circle, sphere, ellipse or ellipsoid.  Refer to <i>qview</i>, <i>camstats</i>,
             or <i>campt</i> as examples of applications that report radius value at every
            image pixel location.
            <p>
               ISIS expects and reports the radius value in Meters.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISIS requires a radius DEM model in order to orthorectify an image
              (refer to <i>spiceinit</i>- shape model/<i>cam2map</i>).  This is not to be
              confused with a topography file where the radius is subtracted
              from the (best fit triaxial or aeroid) shape of the target body.

          </definition>

          <definition name="Emission Angle"><a name="emission angle"></a>
            The emission angle (EMA) is the angle between the spacecraft and a
            vector drawn perpendicular to the planet's surface (surface normal).
            Using SPICE, ISIS applications compute this angle from the ellipsoid.
            <p>
              Emission Angle is in degrees.  The valid range is between 0 and 90.

          <definition name="Incidence Angle">
            The incidence angle (INC) is the angle between the sun and the

            every pixel.
            <p>
              Incidence Angle is in degrees.  The valid range is between 0 - 90.
              Data can be illuminated beyond the 90 degrees in the deep terminator
              region.   While this is valid, most photometric functions will
              not normalize beyond 90 degrees.

          <definition name="Phase Angle">
            The phase angle is the angle between the sun and the spacecraft at a point

            of a pixel.
          </definition>

           <definition name="Oblique Pixel Resolution"><a name="oblique_pixel_resolution"></a>
            The ground distance (in meters) from the left edge to the right edge
            of a pixel.  This value is based on the <a href="#oblique_detector_resolution">oblique detector resolution</a>
            estimate, rather than the <a href="#detector_resolution">detector resolution</a> and is more accurate
            (particularly for off-nadir images).
          </definition>



          <definition name="Line Resolution"><a name="line_resolution"></a>
            The ground distance (in meters) from the top edge to the bottom edge

            estimate, rather than the <a href="#detector_resolution">detector resolution</a> and is more
            accurate (particularly for off-nadir images).

          </definition>



          <definition name="Sample Resolution"><a name="sample_resolution"></a>
            The ground distance (in meters) from the left edge to the right edge
            of a pixel.  
          </definition>

          <definition name="Oblique Sample Resolution"><a name="oblique_sample_resolution"></a>
            The ground distance (in meters) from the left edge to the right edge
            of a pixel.  This value is based on the <a href="#oblique_detector_resolution">oblique detector resolution</a>
            estimate, rather than the <a href="#detector_resolution">detector resolution</a> and is more
            accurate (particularly for off-nadir images).
          </definition>



          <definition name="Detector Resolution"><a name="detector_resolution"></a>          
            The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge of a detector.  If the 
	    lines and samples are not being summed and averaged, this value is equal to the pixel resolution.
            The formula for estimating this value works well if the image is taken near nadir, but 
            the accuracy falls off rapidly the farther off-nadir the image is taken.  For an estimate that 
	    handles off-nadir images with higher accuracy, one should use <a href="#oblique_detector_resolution">oblique detector resolution</a>.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Oblique Detector Resolution"><a name="oblique_detector_resolution"></a>
            This provides an improved estimate to the standard <a href="#detector_resolution">detector resolution</a> when the image is taken at an oblique 
            angle.  In Figure 1A below, an image of the Dufay X crater that was taken near nadir is displayed.  Figure 1B is a
            color map showing the relative difference between the oblique detector resolution, and the original detector resolution as a function
            of the emission angle.  For small emission angles (near nadir) the relative difference between the two estimates 
            is very small.  For larger emission angles (off-nadir), the relative difference between the 
            two estimates increases rapidly.  Figure 2A is an image of the Carlini crater group taken at an oblique angle.  Figure 2B is a color plot
            of the relative difference between the two estimates showing a minimum of approximately 120% when the 
            emission angles off-nadir are in the range 64-75 degrees.  The traditional approximation is obviously not adequate for a case such
            as this, and the oblique detector resolution should be used.

          <definition name="Ground Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle between one reference point and another reference
            point.  Each pixel location has a latitude and longitude associated with
            it (ground point).  The only information required to calculate a
            ground azimuth is to form a spherical triangle from three points on
            the planet (ground point, North Pole, and point of interest). The
            point of interest is often the sub-spacecraft or sub-solar point.
            Spherical trigonometry is then used to calculate the angle.
            <p>
              Ground Azimuth has nothing to do with the image, meaning it does
              not rely on camera geometry for its calculation.

          <definition name="Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to a point of interest.

              The azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a
              reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
              horizontally from the origin point to the right side of the image (3
              o'clock reference if the image is viewed as a clock face) Azimuth

              The North Azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a
              reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
              horizontally from the origin point (pixel location) to the right

            <p>
              The Spacecraft Azimuth is measured in a positive
              clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference line is
              formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point (pixel

          <definition name="Off Nadir Angle">
            From the spacecraft, the Off Nadir is the angle between the nadir
            vector (subspacecraft vector) and the look vector.  Every pixel in
            the image will result in a different Off Nadir Angle.

            (i.e., center of framing camera) and the nadir vector (subspacecraft
            vector).  The Slew angle will be a constant value across the image.

            to the subspacecraft latitude and longitude point.
            <p>
              The subspacecraft ground azimuth is complementary to the emission
              angle and can help to determine if two images would make a good
              stereo pair.  If the camera position (subspacecraft ground
              azimuth) is the same in both images they would not offer stereo.
              If the camera position is slightly off between the two images,
              then they would make a good stereo pair

            subsolar latitude and longitude point.
            <p>
              The Subsolar Ground Azimuth is complementary to the incidence
              angle and gives more information about which direction the sun is
              coming from.

            The local emission angle is the angle between the spacecraft and a
            vector drawn perpendicular to the planet's surface (surface normal).
            <p>
              Using SPICE, ISIS applications compute this angle using an elevation model
              (e.g., local slopes) at every pixel; ONLY if the elevation model exists on the
              image cube labels (Instrument Group, ShapeModel keyword, Refer to the <i>spiceinit</i>
              application).  If the elevation model does not exist, the computation will

             a list of overlapping images all tied together through
             a network of control points and image measures (Refer to
             Control Measures).
             <p>
             Multiple islands can be identified within a single network
             if groups of images are isolated from one another due to no
             overlap or the absence of possible image measures.

              planet kernel (PCK) for high-accuracy orientation (rotation) 
              data for any solar system target body.
              This kernel includes location of the pole, prime meridian,

             Ephemeris Time (ET) as defined by NAIF (Toolkit used by ISIS),
             is the uniform scale represented by the independent variable in
             the differential equations that describe the motions of the planets,
             sun and moon.  Ephemeris time is described as a count of ephemeris
             seconds past the ephemeris reference epoch (J2000).
             <p>
               The basic spatial reference system for SPICE is the J2000 system.
               This is an inertial reference frame in which the equations of
               motion for the solar system may be integrated.  This reference
               frame is specified by the orientation of the earth's mean equator
               and equinox at a particular ephoch...the J2000 epoch.  This epoch
               is Greenwich noon on January 1 2000 Barycentric Dynamical Time.

            names are formed from the calendar date and time of day.  UTC format
            consists of year, month, day, hour, minutes and seconds.
             <p>

             How high the sun is in the sky as seen from a particular site
             on the surface of a planet.  The local solar time at a site on a
             body is the angular difference between the planetocentric longitude
             of the site and the planetocentric longitude of the Sun as seen
             from the center of the body.

          <definition name="PVL">
             Parameter Value Language (PVL) is used extensively by
             ISIS as a standard keyword value type language for naming and
             expressing data values. PVL format in ISIS is compatible with
             syntax used by the Planetary Data System.
             <p>
              For example, the keyword labels of a typical ISIS image cube
              is in PVL format (refer to <i>catlab</i> in order to view image cube labels).
              A parameter name (or keyword name) is used to reference the value.
              The value portion of an assignment statement may contain a simple value
              (i.e., numeric, string, date/time value), a set or a sequence of values.
             </p>
             <p>
              Refer to the ISIS application, <i>getkey</i>, for one method of
              extracting data values from a PVL formatted file.

            equator.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Look Direction">
            The look direction is the direction that the instrument is pointing. 
            In ISIS, it is represented as a mathematical unit vector. 
            For images that have a body (i.e. not star fields), 
            this vector is parallel to the line from the sensor to the observed point 
            on the surface of the target. The look direction can be represented in 
            any of several coordinate systems, including: <a href="#Body-FixedCoordinateSystem">
            Body-fixed coordinate system</a>, <a href="#CameraCoordinateSystem">Camera coordinate system</a>,
            <a href="#J2000CoordinateSystem">J2000 coordinate system</a>.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Body-Fixed Coordinate System">
            A body-fixed coordinate system is used to determine positions and directions 
            of objects and vectors with respect to a target body. The origin is at the 
            center of mass for the target and the axes rotate and move through space with 
            the body. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin 
            is non-constant. Many body-fixed coordinate systems, or reference frames, are 
            defined in NAIF PCK files.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Camera Coordinate System">
            A camera coordinate system is used to determine positions and directions 
            of objects and vectors with respect to a sensor (i.e. camera). The origin
            is at the center of the sensor and the axes rotate and move through space 
            with the sensor. These systems are non-inertial, meaning the velocity of the origin 
            is non-constant. The location of the center of a spacecraft and its instruments 
            at a given time are defined in NAIF SPK files. Generally, one or more frames are 
            associated with a particular instrument.
          </definition>

          <definition name="J2000 Coordinate System">
            The J2000 coordinate system (also known as EME2000) is based on the earth 
            mean equator and dynamical equinox at midnight January 1, 2000. The origin 
            is at the solar system barycenter. This system is inertial, since it does not 
            rotate with respect to stars and the origin is not accelerating (i.e it has a 
            constant velocity). This coordinate system is the root reference for NAIF's SPICE 
            files and software.
