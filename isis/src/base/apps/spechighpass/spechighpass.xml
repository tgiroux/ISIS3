    Apply a spectral high pass filter to a cube
  </brief>

  <description>
    This program applies a spectral high pass filter to a cube. The spectral 
    component means that this will be a high pass amongst the bands of an image 
    as opposed to averaging the lines and samples on the spacial plane with high 
    pass. A highpass filter involves subtracting a lowpass, the average, from 
    the original value.

        Example of usage of the spectral highpass filter.
      </brief>
      <description>
        This example shows a spectral highpass filter being applied to the image 
        with a 15 depth boxcar. This cube has 256 bands so 15 is relatively 
        small. Although no averaging is done within a single band, the averaging 
        of the pixels of many bands will cause some averaging and smoothing of 
        the image if there is much difference between bands. Here is an image 
        which highlights which pixels a single pass would average. The image 
        shows a 9x9 dot instead of a single pixel highlighted to make it more 
        visible. In this picture the boxcar would be seven or more bands, with 
        the output pixel being one of the visible pixels. Depending on how large 
        the boxcar was many of the values taken in could not be original, at a 
        minimum, one value will be mirrored since there are only six available 
        bands.

            This is the spectral plot of the center point of the image, (32,
            32), and shows all bands, 1- 256. No averaging has been applied,
            this is clear partialy because of th extreme peaks visible in the 
            first half. The peaks are related to values which differ 
            significantly from the bands around them.

            In this image the differences is that everything has been lowered
