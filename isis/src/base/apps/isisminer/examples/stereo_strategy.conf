      #  Now specify how the stereo quality is determined.  Values will be sorted

      #  Keyword is 3[ or 4]-vector: StereoThresholds = (minimum, maximum, nominal 
      #  [, weight]).  Rank is determined by computing a pivot point from nominal
      #  and scaling it to 1.  A weight for each is optional but defaults to 1.
      #  Angles can be in degrees or radians but must be specified accordingly.
      #  These are all mapped to Resource keywords and the KeywordMap group
      #  can be used to specify keyword sources - if they differ from the
      #  keyword names here.  Of course, the CalculatorStrategy can be used
      #  to precompute any values you want to threshold here.  Any threshold that
      #  is exceeded results in the Resource (image) to be discarded.  Note also
      #  the keywords will store these results back in the Resource::Asset list
      #  for each matched pair (a unique keyword set is created from the
      #  original candidate (SourceB) keywords). For example, the Incidence
      #  keyword will contain the value of the equation applied as follows:
      #  
      #      Incidence = 1.0 - ( (fabs(incidence[2] - IncidenceAngle)) /
      #                          (incidence[1] - incidence[0]) )
      #      if ( exists(indicence[3]) ) Incidence = Incidence * incidence[3]
      #
      #  Hence, since all values have the default weight, the maximum score
      #  is 4.0.  The sum of all four evaluations below are summed and stored
      #  in the StereoThresholds keyword in the Asset::StereoPair result for
      #  each matched pair.  See the Equation keyword above for final ranking.
      #
      #  All these keywords are optional and you can create unique ones from
      #  keyword values you know to exist in your input set.  All are weighted
      #  at 1.0 (w/absence of 4th value) with a nominal score of 4.0
