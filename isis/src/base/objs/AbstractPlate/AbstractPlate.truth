Virtual class... first create a child
plate name =  "AbstractPlate"
Construct intercept from vertex (0,0,0), vector(1,1,1), and surface point(2,2,2).
intercept plate name                 =  "AbstractPlate"
intercept vertex (observer position) =  "( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 )"
intercept vector (look direction)    =  "( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 )"
intercept surface point (location)   =  2 2 2  meters
