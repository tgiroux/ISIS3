Begin testing Dem Shape Model class....
Shape name is EquatorialCylindricalShape
Shape is DEM type? Yes

Testing method intersectSurface...
  Do we have an intersection? 0

 Set a pixel in the image and check again.
  Do we have an intersection? 1
   surface point = (-2123.36, -2380.37, 1194.68)

Testing a condition that previously caused qview and spiceinit to hang instead of failing.
...  intersectSurface method failed
