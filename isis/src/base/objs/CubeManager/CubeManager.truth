Verify cube attributes have been taken into account
  Cube # | # of Bands
  Cube 1 | 2
  Cube 2 | 2
  Cube 3 | 1
  Cube 4 | 1
  Cube 5 | 1
  Cube 6 | 1

Verify blobTruth cubes have been cleaned

Set number of open cubes to 2

Currently managed cubes:
  1 : isisTruth
  2 : blobTruth

Opened isisTruth2.cub.
Verify isisTruth2.cub is now managed and limit of 2 is enforced:
  1 : blobTruth
  2 : isisTruth2

Setting number of open cubes > 60 percent of system open file limit

Attempting to open a file that does not exist:
