***** Testing One dimensional Minimizations using GSL's brentminimizer *****
xa = 0 xb = 6

Without using minbracket, Starting Minimum
Test Minimum=2
brentminimizer's Converged Minimum = 3.14159

Using minbracket for Starting Minimum
minbracket Minimum=15.7082
brentminimizer's Converged Minimum = 15.708
